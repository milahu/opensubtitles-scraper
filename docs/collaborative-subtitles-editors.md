## captionfy.com

captionfy.com seems to allow collaborative subtitles editing for youtube videos

https://www.reddit.com/r/captionfy/comments/kf40nw/collaborative_captions_are_now_allowed_on/

> I just released a new version allowing the users to choose if they want to work alone on the captions (like it has always been) or if they want to allow others to help. This can be selected in a toggle upon creating captions or editing captions.

> Captionfy has a custom YouTube subtitle editor that anyone can use to caption YouTube videos (both the YouTubers and their viewers can use it). It's a new platform and accepts suggestions from anyone.

## amara.org

> For any videos hosted online, including on one's server, http://amara.org/ (also open source) does the job finely and you can actually collaborate with several people.
