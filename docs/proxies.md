why should i pay for a scraping service
when i can use free proxy servers?

or will cloudflare block ALL these proxies?

## FlareSolverr

https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr

> it uses Selenium with the [undetected-chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver) to create a web browser (Chrome).
> It opens the URL with user parameters and waits until the Cloudflare challenge is solved (or timeout).
> The HTML code and the cookies are sent back to the user, and those cookies can be used to bypass Cloudflare using other HTTP clients.

> NOTE: Web browsers consume a lot of memory.
> If you are running FlareSolverr on a machine with few RAM, do not make many requests at once.
> With each request a new browser is launched.
